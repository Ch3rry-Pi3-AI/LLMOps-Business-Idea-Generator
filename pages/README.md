# 🌐 LLMOps Business Idea Generator – Pages Folder

This folder contains the **Next.js frontend pages** for the **Business Idea Generator**, now updated to support **real-time streaming output**.
These files define how the user interface looks, behaves, and dynamically receives data from the backend API as the idea is generated live.

## ⚙️ What Each File Does

### `index.tsx`

* This is the **homepage** that users see first.
* Connects to the backend (`/api`) using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for live streaming.
* Displays the business idea in real time as it’s generated by the model.
* Uses **ReactMarkdown** with **GFM** and **line-break** plugins to render formatted text cleanly.
* Styled with **Tailwind CSS**, supporting both light and dark modes.

### `_app.tsx`

* The **main wrapper** for all pages in the application.
* Ensures that global styles (like Tailwind) apply across the site.
* A good place to later add providers, global themes, or state management logic.

### `_document.tsx`

* Defines the **base HTML structure** for all pages.
* Includes metadata such as the app title and description for SEO.
* Serves as the foundation for adding analytics, favicons, or global scripts in the future.

## 🧩 How It Works Together

1. The user opens the homepage (`index.tsx`).
2. The browser establishes a **live SSE connection** to `/api`.
3. The backend streams text output token by token.
4. The React component updates the display continuously using Markdown rendering.
